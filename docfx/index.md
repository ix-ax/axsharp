**IX is an open-source project developed by a group of automation engineers. It provides easy access from .NET-based applications to SIMATIC-AX based PLC programs.**

Open source repository is [here](https://github.com/ix-ax/ix).

>[!NOTE]
>This project is under development. We periodically release versions that can be used for testing and in non-production environments.




## Disclaimer

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **It is necessary to have a valid license for SIMATIC AX in order to use IX!**  
SIMATIC AX is currently in a limited sales release in selected European countries only. You will need to request access from the AX team which will check if your use case is suitable for the current state of the product. The first step to getting the approval is contacting your local SIEMENS sales representative or writing an email to [simatic-ax@siemens.com](mailto:simatic-ax@siemens.com?subject=Request%20for%20access%20|%20SIMATIC%20AX%20for%20IX).

## What's in

## [AXSharp.ixc compiler](~/articles/compiler/README.md)

Transpiles the structured text program data to .NET twin objects. These objects provide different methods of accessing the PLC data. Twin objects are suitable to use for HMI (with any .NET UI framework like *WPF, Blazor, MAUI or WinForms*). Twins implement value change notifications which makes it easy for the UI framework to react to changes in the PLC.

Mirroring the PLC program in a .NET object gives any solution consistency and scalability on a scale hard to achieve with traditional approaches.

## [AXSharp.Connectors](~/articles/connectors/README.md)

The connectors provide a communication layer for twin objects generated by the compiler (ixc).

## [AXSharp.Blazor](~/articles/blazor/README.md)

The presentations provide a mechanism for automated UI generation from PLC code. The UI layout and properties are malleable with the directives in the PLC code.

## Prerequisites

- [axcode](https://axcite.me)
- [dotnet 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [dotnet 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or [vs2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

> **Make sure you have installed both .NET6 and .NET7.**

## Getting started

Make sure you meet all [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

### Add package source

To get early access to the packages from `IX` you will need to get access to a dedicated package feed hosted on GitHub. If you do not have a GitHub account please consider creating one by signing up at https://github.com.

~~~
dotnet nuget add source --username GITHUBUSERNAME --password PAT  --store-password-in-clear-text --name gh-packages-ix-ax "https://nuget.pkg.github.com/ix-ax/index.json"
~~~

Replace GITHUBUSERNAME with your github name
Replace PAT with your Personal Access Token ([how to create your PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token))

### Using templates

Install IX template package

When using .NET7
~~~
dotnet new install AXSharp.templates
~~~

When using .NET6 and earlier
~~~
dotnet new --install AXSharp.templates
~~~
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure all nuget feed sources are available at the time of installation of packages.
If you are not sure run `dotnet nuget list source` and check that the sources listed are reachable.
The installation may fail if some of the source is not available.

List available templates

~~~
dotnet new list --tag ix

Template Name                   Short Name  Language  Tags
------------------------------  ----------  --------  -----------------
IX Blazor application           ixblazor    [C#]      IX/Blazor
IX Simmple console application  ixconsole   [C#]      IX/Console-Simple
IX twin project                 ixtwin      [C#]      IX/Twin Library
.
.
.
~~~

Create new project from template

~~~
dotnet new [shortname] -n YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
~~~

#### Prepare your PLC and AX project

Using TIA portal you need to enable WebAPI interface [see here](https://console.simatic-ax.siemens.io/docs/hwld/PlcWebServer) and [here](https://youtu.be/d9EX2FixY1A?t=151) is a very informative youtube video.


Consult README.md file located in your new project for additionatl information.

### From scratch

#### Install `ixc` IX compiler CLI

`ixc` is CLI implementation of IX Compiler.

Open the terminal in the directory of your AX project (the one where the apax.yml file lives), and run the following commands:

~~~
dotnet new tool-manifest 
dotnet tool install --local AXSharp.ixc --prerelease
~~~

This will install the `ixc` compiler tool for your project.

#### Run `ixc` tool in your project directory

To run `ixc` do in your ax project directory:

~~~
dotnet ixc
~~~

`ixc` will create a new folder (defaults to `ix` in your ax project folder) where you can find the C# Twin project of your AX program.

The ixc help can be displayed running.

~~~
dotnet ixc --help

ixc 0.5.0-1.8+Branch.wip-webapiconnector-1.Sha.7b12285dc7e7aa72995e9e47bbcf7f4cf386f170
Copyright (C) 2022 author

  -x, --source-project-folder    Simatic-ax project folder

  -o, --output-project-folder    Output folder.

  --help                         Display this help screen.

  --version                      Display version information.
~~~

Before usage apax commanad ensure that you are logged in
~~~
apax login 
~~~

Run apax install to install dependencies of your AX project
~~~
apax install 
~~~


You will need to load your PLC with `--default-server-interface` in render your PLC program data accessible via WebAPI interface.

~~~
apax build
apax sld -t YOUR-SYSTEM-IP -i .\bin\1500\ --accept-security-disclaimer -r --default-server-interface
~~~

## Connecting PLC.NET Twin to the PLC

~~~C#
using AXSharp.Connector;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using AXSharp.Connector.Sax.WebApi;

namespace your_project_name
{
    public static class Entry
    {
        // Connecting to read PLC using WebAPI
        public static my_plcTwinController Plc { get; } = new (ConnectorAdapterBuilder.Build().CreateWebApi("10.10.101.1", "Everybody", "", true));
        // Connecting to dummy
        public static my_plcTwinController PlcDummy { get; } = new (ConnectorAdapterBuilder.Build().CreateDummy());
    }
}
~~~

Start PLC twin operations

~~~C#
// This start cyclical operation on PLCTwin at 10ms rate
your_project_name.Entry.Plc.Connector.BuildAndStart().ReadWriteCycleDelay = 10;
~~~
